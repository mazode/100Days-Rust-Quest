# Day 3

## Summary

Today, I finished Chapter 3 of the Rust book. The chapter covered:

- **Variables**: Declaration and usage.
- **Data Types**: Scalar types and compound types.
- **Functions**: Definition and calling, including parameters and return types.
- **Comments**: Usage of single-line and multi-line comments.
- **Control Flow**: `if` expressions, loops (`for`, `while`, `loop`).

### Exercise 1: Temperature Conversion Program

I completed the temperature conversion program exercise. The program performs the following:

1. Asks the user to select a conversion type: Celsius to Fahrenheit or Fahrenheit to Celsius.
2. Prompts the user to enter the temperature value.
3. Converts the temperature based on the user's choice.
4. Displays the converted temperature.
