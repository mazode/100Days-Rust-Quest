# Day 4

## Summary

Today, I completed the program exercise for Chapter 3, which involved generating the nth Fibonacci number.

### nth Fibonacci Number Generation

I developed a program to calculate the nth Fibonacci number, which includes the following steps:

1. **User Input:** Prompts the user to input the position in the Fibonacci sequence.
2. **Iteration:** Uses a loop to compute the Fibonacci number iteratively.
3. **Calculation:** Computes the Fibonacci number by iterating from the base cases up to the desired position.
4. **Output:** Displays the nth Fibonacci number to the user.

The final implementation uses a `for` loop to efficiently compute the Fibonacci number.

## Key Concepts

- **Input Handling:** Reading and parsing user input.
- **Base Cases:** Handling special cases for the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Iteration:** Efficiently calculating the Fibonacci sequence using a loop.
