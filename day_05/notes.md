# Day 5

## Summary

Today, I completed the final program from Chapter 3: printing the lyrics to the Christmas carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas."

### Christmas Carol "The Twelve Days of Christmas"

The program prints the lyrics of the Christmas carol by:

1. Looping through the 12 days.
2. Using an array to store gifts and printing them in reverse order up to the current day.
3. Adding "and" before the first gift on all days except the first.
